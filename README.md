# Transformer-Architecture

implemented the Transformer architecture folling a walkthrough from *Deep Learning with Python second Edition* by *Fran√ßois Chollet* 

Folling the Book gudiance 
1. Implemented the transformers Encoder and used it for a text classification task 
2. Implemented a transformers Encoder-Decoder Architecture used for a machine translation task

This Excercise helped me understand 
1. The Limitations of RNN for NLP task 
2. The workings of a transformere architecture better, the purpose of its layers, how they work and how it all comes together to form the transformer Model
